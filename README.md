# Weekend-jquery-server-calculator


## Description

_Duration: 8 hours_

For this project I made a basic calculator tht has the ability to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I added a spot for a history area that allows you to see what calculations you have done and also has the ability to display the answer on click so you don't need to re-enter the equation in the calculator. The other functionality that was added to the calculator is using Node Express to have a server side to the calculator. This was used so you would have the ability of refreshing your browser and not lose your history on the page. 

To see functionality follow the installation steps then visit localhost:5000/index.html
